## About the Project üìù
The goal of this project is to predict food delivery times using machine learning algorithms. We analyze factors such as:
- Distance between the restaurant and delivery location
- Weather conditions
- Order preparation time
- Delivery agent performance

This project is built to help food delivery services optimize their operations and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chetanp2002/Food-Delivery-Prediction.git
   cd Food-Delivery-Prediction
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
    - For Windows
        ```bash
        python -m venv env
        .\env\Scripts\activate
    - For macOS/Linux
    ```bash
        python3 -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate
3. Install the required dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Launch the Jupyter notebook
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Food_Delivery_Prediction.ipynb
5. Run the notebook

Open the notebook and execute cells step-by-step to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Troubleshooting
- If Jupyter Notebook is not installed, install it with:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook

- Check your Python version (Python 3.7 or above is recommended):
    ```bash
    python --version


## Project Workflow üöÄ
1. **Import Libraries:** Essential Python libraries for analysis and modeling.
2. **Load and Understand Data:** Initial data exploration to grasp structure and summary.
3. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Handling missing values
    - Encoding categorical variables
    - Scaling numerical features
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
    - Visualizing trends and patterns
    - Correlation analysis
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - Comparing multiple regression models
    - Evaluating performance with appropriate metrics


## Key Results:
 - Model Performance:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3.17
   - R-Squared (R¬≤): 0.82
   - Best Performing Model: XGBoost Regressor

## Ideas for Future Development:
 - Integrate real-time data for live predictions.
 - Include external features such as traffic data or weather conditions.
 - Develop a more beautiful user-friendly web interface to display predictions.
